- Characteristics of network topologies: star, mesh, bus, hybrid  
- Common cabling types: UTP, STP, fiber optic, coaxial  
- TCP vs UDP protocols  
- IPv4 and IPv6 addressing  
- Subnetting and CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)  
- Default gateway and DNS purpose  
- Static vs dynamic IP addressing  
- Network types: LAN, WAN, WLAN, MAN, PAN  
- Network virtualization fundamentals (VLANs, Hypervisors, Virtual Switches)
